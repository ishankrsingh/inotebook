# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# Note: In this .gitignore file (which was created using npx-create-react-app), we have /node_modules (and node_modules is present in both frontend and backend), because of which if we try to push anything to git, changes made to both the node_modules folder will get pushed to git. So we will just remove the '/' before node_modules in .gitignore file, which then will only push changes changes made to node_modules folder present in frontend.
